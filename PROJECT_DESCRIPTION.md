# MensentaalMachine 2.0
## Project Description for Presentation

---

## Overview

**MensentaalMachine** is an intelligent language simplification platform designed to transform complex written content into clear, accessible communication. The platform uses advanced artificial intelligence to adapt text for different audiences, ensuring that important information reaches everyone—regardless of their reading level or background.

---

## The Challenge

In today's information-rich world, organizations often struggle to communicate complex topics in ways that are accessible to diverse audiences. Government communications, policy documents, and institutional messaging frequently contain technical language, jargon, and complex structures that can exclude or confuse readers. This creates barriers to understanding and engagement.

---

## The Solution

MensentaalMachine bridges the gap between complex information and accessible communication. The platform:

- **Simplifies complex text** while preserving meaning and accuracy
- **Adapts content** for different target audiences (general public, youth, elderly)
- **Customizes output formats** for various communication channels (social media, professional networks, summaries)
- **Considers context** including geographic location and communication level (local, provincial, regional, federal)
- **Maintains consistency** through customizable dictionaries and reference materials

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Text Simplification
Users can input any complex text, and the platform automatically generates simplified versions tailored to their specific needs. The AI considers multiple factors including the target audience, desired output format, and relevant context.

### Context-Aware Processing
The system understands the Belgian governance structure and can adapt language based on:
- **Communication levels**: Local, Provincial, Regional, Community, and Federal
- **Geographic context**: Specific cities and regions across Belgium
- **Project-specific requirements**: Customizable settings for different initiatives

### Flexible & Customizable Output Formats
Content can be formatted for various purposes with built-in formats or completely custom structures:
- **Built-in formats**: Summaries, social media posts (Instagram-style), professional content (LinkedIn-style), and structured bullet points
- **Custom output formats**: Create your own formats with specific section structures (e.g., landing pages with hero sections, feature lists, and call-to-action sections)
- **Dynamic structure building**: Define custom output structures with ordered sections, required/optional fields, and detailed instructions
- **Format templates**: Save and reuse custom formats across projects and teams

### Research Mode
An advanced feature that enables the AI to gather additional context from web sources before simplifying text, ensuring the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Team Collaboration
Organizations can organize their work through:
- **Team management**: Structure users into teams with appropriate access levels
- **Project organization**: Group related simplification tasks together
- **Reference library**: Maintain shared knowledge bases and approved content
- **Activity tracking**: Monitor usage and maintain audit trails

### Customization & Control
- **Dictionary management**: Define preferred terms and their simplified alternatives
- **Custom output formats**: Create formats with custom section structures, ordering, and requirements for specialized use cases
- **Prompt templates**: Save and reuse successful simplification approaches
- **Approval workflows**: Review and approve content before publication
- **Analytics dashboard**: Track usage patterns and measure impact
